# CellIDPaperScript

This is the repository to reproduce the figures for Cell-ID manuscript. To download Cell-ID please refer to https://github.com/RausellLab/CelliD or https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/html/CelliD.html. The CellID legacy branch on github was used for manuscript results, small difference can occur due to dependencies package versionning and system.  All data are downloaded through code.
